# learning_html
Dedicated repository to show my progress with HTML  

First class in the faculty of HTML, this class was spent on the implementation of HTML and how it works.

HTML is basically a markup language very similar to .MD (markdown).

In the file I uploaded together there is a demonstration of how HTML works.

The first part in the "feature / writing_strips" branch is showing how font sizes are typed in HTML.

PS: Everything placed below with <>, in fact there are no spaces.

The code starts with <html> and ends with </html>, the page title is a block that starts with <head> and ends with </head>. The text is another block that starts with <body> and ends with </body>. To define the header and the size of which you are writing, just in one line put h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 or h6, example: **<h2> "type the text here without quotes" </h2>**
